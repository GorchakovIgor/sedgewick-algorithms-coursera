**Taxicab numbers.** 

A taxicab number is an integer that can be expressed as the sum of two cubes of positive integers in two different ways: **a^3 + b^3 = c^3 + d^3** . For example, **1729** is the smallest taxicab number: **9^3 + 10^3 = 1^3 + 12^3**. Design an algorithm to find all taxicab numbers with **a**, **b**, **c**, and **d** less than **n**.
