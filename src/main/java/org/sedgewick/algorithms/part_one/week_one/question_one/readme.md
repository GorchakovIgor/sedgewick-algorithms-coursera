**Social network connectivity.** 

Given a social network containing _n_ members and a log file containing _m_ timestamps at which times pairs of members formed friendships, design an algorithm to determine the earliest time at which all members are connected (i.e., every member is a friend of a friend of a friend ... of a friend). Assume that the log file is sorted by timestamp and that friendship is an equivalence relation. The running time of your algorithm should be _m log n_ or better and use extra space proportional to _n_.
