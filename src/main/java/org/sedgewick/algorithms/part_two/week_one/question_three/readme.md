**Euler cycle.** An Euler cycle in a graph is a cycle (not necessarily simple) that uses every edge in the graph exactly one.

* Show that a connected graph has an Euler cycle if and only if every vertex has even degree.
* Design a linear-time algorithm to determine whether a graph has an Euler cycle, and if so, find one.
