**Perfect matchings in k-regular bipartite graphs.** 

Suppose that there are **n** men and **n** women at a dance and that each man knows exactly **k** women and each woman knows exactly **k** men (and relationships are mutual). Show that it is always possible to arrange a dance so that each man and woman are matched with someone they know.
