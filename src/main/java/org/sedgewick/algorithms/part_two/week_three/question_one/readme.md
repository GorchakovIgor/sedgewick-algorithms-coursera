**Fattest path.** 

Given an edge-weighted digraph and two vertices **s** and **t**, design an **E log E** algorithm to find a fattest path from **s** to **t**. The *bottleneck capacity* of a path is the minimum weight of an edge on the path. A *fattest path* is a path such that no other path has a higher bottleneck capacity.
