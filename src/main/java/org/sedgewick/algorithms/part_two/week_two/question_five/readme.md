**Second shortest path.** 

Given an edge-weighted digraph and let **P** be a shortest path from vertex **s** to vertex **t**. Design an **E log V** algorithm to find a path (not necessarily simple) other than **P** from **s** to **t** that is as short as possible. Assume all of the edge weights are strictly positive.
