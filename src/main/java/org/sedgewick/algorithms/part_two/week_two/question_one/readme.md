**Bottleneck minimum spanning tree.** 

Given a connected edge-weighted graph, design an efficient algorithm to find a minimum bottleneck spanning tree. The bottleneck capacity of a spanning tree is the weights of its largest edge. A minimum bottleneck spanning tree is a spanning tree of minimum bottleneck capacity.
