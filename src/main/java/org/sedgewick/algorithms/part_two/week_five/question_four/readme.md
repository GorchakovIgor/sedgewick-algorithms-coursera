**Ternary Huffman codes.** 

Generalize the Huffman algorithm to codewords over **the ternary alphabet (0, 1, and 2)** instead of the binary alphabet. That is, given a bytestream, find a prefix-free ternary code that uses as few trits (0s, 1s, and 2s) as possible. Prove that it yields optimal prefix-free ternary code.
