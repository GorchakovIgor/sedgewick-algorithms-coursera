**Challenging REs.** 

Construct a regular expression for each of the following languages over the binary alphabet or prove that no such regular expression is possible:

* All strings except 11 or 111.
* Strings with 1 in every odd-number bit position.
* Strings with an equal number of 0s and 1s.
* Strings with at least two 0s and at most one 1.
* Strings that when interpreted as a binary integer are a multiple of 3.
* Strings with no two consecutive 1s.
* Strings that are palindromes (same forwards and backwards).
* Strings with an equal number of substrings of the form 01 and 10.
