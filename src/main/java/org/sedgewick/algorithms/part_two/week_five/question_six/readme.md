**Move-to-front coding.** 

Design an algorithm to implement move-to-front encoding so that each operation takes logarithmic time in the worst case. That is, maintain alphabet of symbols in a list. A symbol is encoded as the number of symbols that precede it in the list. After encoding a symbol, move it to the front of the list.
